## 💡 Strategic Reasoning

### Why This Breakdown Works:

1. **FREE → BASIC** ($0 → $30/month)
   - **Key differentiator:** Maintenance tracking, contracts, expenses
   - **ROI for customer:** These features save way more than $30/month in operational efficiency
   - **Conversion trigger:** When they hit 5 vehicles or need maintenance tracking

2. **BASIC → PREMIUM** ($30 → $100/month)
   - **Key differentiator:** Unlimited scale, white-label, dedicated support
   - **ROI for customer:** Enterprise features justify 3x price for fleets with 25+ vehicles
   - **Conversion trigger:** When they hit 25 vehicles or need white-label/custom features

3. **Clear Value Ladder:**
   - FREE: Test the water, basic operations
   - BASIC: Professional fleet management
   - PREMIUM: Enterprise-grade, scalable solution

## 🚀 Recommended Next Steps

1. **Update the plan configurations** in the database via `/superadmin/plans`
2. **Implement feature gates** in the code to enforce limits
3. **Add upgrade CTAs** when users hit limits
4. **Create comparison page** for users to see differences
5. **Add usage tracking** to show how close they are to limits

Would you like me to help implement any of these features or create the enforcement logic?
